This repository contains all the info required for the RMarkdown session of 
the **Data Management for Publishing: Accessibility and Reproducibility**
workshop to be taught on April 23rd, 2022.


The goal of the session is to familiarize yourself with the basics
of RMarkdown to produce automated reports that contain both R code
and its output together.

The data analyzed is a subset of the data from the
[surh/wheelP](https://github.com/surh/wheelP) R package.

# Requirements

All you need is a relativeley recent version of R, RStudio and
the tidyverse package collection. Pretty much any version should
work but the workshop was developped with the following versions

* R 4.1.0
* RStudio 1.4.1717
* tidyverse 1.3.1

All
resources for the Rmarkdown session of the workshop, plus some additional
ones, can be found in the GitHub repository
[surh/Rmarkdown_workshop](https://github.com/surh/Rmarkdown_workshop).

The data and code in this document reproduce some of the analysis from
@HerreraParedes2018. The full data and code from that publication can be found
in the GitHub repository [surh/wheelP](https://github.com/surh/wheelP).
